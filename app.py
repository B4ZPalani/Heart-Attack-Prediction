        Did you know that machine learning models can help you
        predict heart disease pretty accurately? In this app, you can
        estimate your chance of heart disease (yes/no) in seconds!
        
        Here, a logistic regression model using an undersampling technique
        was constructed using survey data of over 300k US residents from the year 2020.
        This application is based on it because it has proven to be better than the random forest
        (it achieves an accuracy of about 80%, which is quite good).
        
        To predict your heart disease status, simply follow the steps bellow:
        1. Enter the parameters that best describe you;
        2. Press the "Predict" button and wait for the result.");
